Worn out, a broken, fucked up mind
An empty shell of life conscious, breathing, feeling
Forced on society's back, nailed to the freak show cross
Submissive lever raging through the veins

Distorting the values set by us all
You've lost all control
Immoral machines all pleasure and greed
Shadow World

Liquify the senses and inhale the poison
A way to find the path to divinity
Arise from filth, always fought for what you believed in
The crystal savior will help you on your way

Distorting the values set by us all
You've lost all control
Immoral machines of pleasure and greed
Shadow World

Slipping away into a twisted state of grace
The pain ignites my growth
Nightmare closing in
Bleeding and begging for an end to come
The spawn of a shadow world

Shadow World

Distorting the values set by us all
You've lost all control
Immoral machines of pleasure and greed
Shadow World
Immoral machines of pleasure and greed
Shadow world
