Truth
Is elusive, it's nowhere to be found
Yea the truth can never be written down

It's not in any magazine
You can't see it on your TV screen

Truth
Is evasive though you might have the facts
Got it straight, you think but then it all cracks
Wide open, you can search the world far and wide
The only truth that you can ever find

Is
In another
A soul that's got the same burning need
To find out what's
Neath the cover-up

The one can't be without the true other
So let's get torether,
See what we can uncover

One
That defines your world
Gives you truth and life

One
That excess
Special enough to guide your way through
This shadow world

I've tired
To imagine what it'd be like without
Knowing you are always right by my side
No doubt I
Can't imagine not knowing trust like
I know with you

Lies
Come in many forms
And some look like truth
But we won't let that confuse me & you
We found a way to see what's right for ourselves
We found our truth in
Someone else, we got

Faith
In each other
Our souls have got the same burning need
To find out what's
Neath the cover-up

The one can't be without the true other
So let's get together, see what we can uncover

Let
There be someone there
That shares truth and love

Who
Really cares
& Knows we can only share our truth through

One
That defines your world
Gives you truth and life

One
That excels
Special enough to guide your way through
This shadow world

Let
There be someone there
That shares truth and love

Who
Really cares
& Knows we can only share our truth through

One
That defines your world
Gives you truth and life

One
That excels
Special enough to guide your way through
This shadow world
