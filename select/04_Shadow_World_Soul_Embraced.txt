Deep inside my shadow world
My fear, my horror, my insanity
The minds eye sees
What's becoming of me

Breaking day slowly turnin'
Towards the negative
Soon I'll forget
I hated this

I hate the dreams
Reality unleashed
The sickness in me

I hate the dreams
Reality unleashed
The sickness in me

Breaking day slowly turnin'
Towards the negative
Soon I'll forget
I hated this

I hate the dreams
Reality unleashed
The sickness in me

I hate the dreams
Reality unleashed
The sickness in me

I hate the dreams
Reality unleashed
The sickness in me

I hate the dreams
Reality unleashed
The sickness in me

The sickness in me
