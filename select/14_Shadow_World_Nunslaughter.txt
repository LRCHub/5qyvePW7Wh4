Shadow world
Dead this world is dead
Wrong so many wrongs
To right as I write these words
Cannot kill
But I can kill
In the shadow world
I kill in the shadow world
In your slumber, I creep through depressive nightmares
Wield the death axe I strike at your contemptuous head
You are reviled by me but I now I am defiling you
I am the lunge in the dark my hands around your neck
Blind this world is blind
Faith can't help your faith
And hope I hope to hate
Cannot kill
But I can kill
In the shadow world
Life seeps to nothingness night consumes all
Through lidless eyes, I watch mirror without reflection
Day devours night I slip past the trees
The edge of my hollow hole I seek the dark
I seek the dark
Faith death
I kill the light
Fate faith death
I kill the light
