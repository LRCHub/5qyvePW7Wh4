Learning to live in this shadow world
(We are from a world)
The outside can't reach within
These old doors, they don't belong
(Of impossible standards)

Trying to live in this shadow world
(We are from a world)
The light can't pierce within
The old bulbs, they've shown too long

But the light burn out
Leaving light in doubt
(We return)
As the sun angles closer
Pull the certain shut, tight,
(To our world)
Against the day
But the light turns out
Leaving life in doubt
(We return)
As the moon pivots further
Pull the certain shut, tight,
Against our age
(Our last chance)
(For experience)

Falling from life in my shadow world
(We are from a world)
The ages pass within
The old times, they've marched too long
(Of impossible standards)

Learning to die in this shadow world
(We are from a world)
The heart aches within
The old boy he's far too gone
(Of perfection)

But the light burns out
Leaving love in doubt
(We return)
Aa the sun angles closer
Pull the certain shut, tight,
(To our world)
Against that day
But the light turns out
Leaving life in doubt
(We retourn)
As the moon pivots further
Pull certain shut, tight,
Agains this age
(Our last chance)
(For experience)
